A password generator is a software tool that creates random or customized passwords for users. It helps users create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access.

These programs produce complex/strong passwords with combinations of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters such as braces, asterisks, slashes, etc.

 - For optimum safety when using a password generator, it’s good to mix up some of the characters and even add or remove some characters before using it. In addition to the generated random password, you also introduce your added randomization, creating an even safer password that is unique..
